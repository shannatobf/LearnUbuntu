I learned you can run and debug Nextcloud through Visual Studio Code using tools like XDebug for PHP. 

Here’s a step-by-step guide of what I referenced to set this up:
Step 1: Install XDebug
Install XDebug:
Open a terminal and install XDebug

sudo apt-get install php-xdebug


Configure XDebug:

Open your php.ini file 
(usually located at /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini or /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini).
Add the following configuration:

zend_extension=/usr/lib/php/20190902/xdebug.so
xdebug.remote_enable=1
xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.remote_port=9000
xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
Restart Apache:

Restart your web server to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart apache2  - REAL ERROR RECEIVED

srowe@Ubuntu:/etc/php/8.3/apache2$ 
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Job for apache2.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status apache2.service" and "journalctl -xeu apache2.service" for details.



Step 2: Configure Visual Studio Code
Install PHP Debug Extension:

Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for and install the PHP Debug extension.
Configure VS Code for XDebug:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select Debug: Open launch.json.
Add the following configuration to launch.json:

Step 3: Enable Debug Mode in Nextcloud
Enable Debug Mode:
Open the config.php file in your Nextcloud installation directory (usually located at /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php).
Add or modify the following line to enable debug mode:

Step 4: Start Debugging
Set Breakpoints:

Open the PHP files you want to debug in Visual Studio Code.
Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
Start Debugging:

Open the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D) and select Listen for XDebug.
Click the green play button to start debugging.
Test Nextcloud:

Open your browser and navigate to your Nextcloud instance.
Perform actions that will trigger the code where you set breakpoints.
Additional Tips
Check Logs: Monitor the Nextcloud logs for any errors or debugging information. The log file is usually located at /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log1.
Browser Extensions: Use browser extensions like XDebug Helper for Chrome to easily start debugging sessions
