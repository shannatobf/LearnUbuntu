1. Introduction to Ubuntu
What is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. It’s designed for ease of use and is popular for its stability, community support, and security features. Ubuntu is used by both beginners and professionals across the world for personal computing, servers, and cloud infrastructure.

9. Learning Challenges and Exercises

Here are some simple tasks you can practice to strengthen your skills.
Task 1: Basic File Management

    Create a directory called myfolder and move into it.

    Change the permissions of myfile.txt to be readable only by the owner.

    Remove mycopy.txt.

Solution:

mkdir myfolder
cd myfolder
touch myfile.txt
cp myfile.txt mycopy.txt
chmod 400 myfile.txt
rm mycopy.txt

Task 2: Install and Remove a Package

    Install the htop package.

    Remove it after you’re done.
